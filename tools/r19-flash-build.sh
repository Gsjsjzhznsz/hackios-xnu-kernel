# tools/r19-flash-build.sh -- pack the r19 SpringBoard boot images for raphael (K20 Pro, hackios).
#
# R19 = the bank's order, not the table's: the reference recipe restored, verbatim.
#
#   KERNEL (xnu/files/bsd/dev/raphael_adreno.c):
#     - R18's war report closed the case with three facts that only fit one
#       explanation: entry 0 read zero at step 8 (before anything was written),
#       it refused the device tree's match through bank 4 and through bank 0,
#       and it refused every free entry with the GMU's entry 1 untouched and
#       working.  The holder is the hypervisor, and what it refuses is not the
#       entry -- it is any SMR/S2CR write that would route a stream into a
#       context bank whose translation is OFF.  The GMU's bank was programmed
#       COMPLETELY and switched ON before its s2cr/smr were touched, and its
#       writes landed from R13 on; the 3D core's bank was dead, and everything
#       written "to the table" died with it.
#     - R19 restores the reference driver's order (the phone the driver comes
#       from; same chip family, same hypervisor, daily-drivable): context bank
#       0 is programmed completely and switched ON first (cb sctlr -> cba2r ->
#       cbar -> tcr2 -> tcr -> ttbr0 -> mair0 -> tlbiasid/tlbsync -> sctlr ON
#       | SERVE_AFTER_FAULT), and only then s2cr(entry 0) = context 0 and
#       smr(entry 0) = VALID | 0x400<<16 | stream 0.  No bank scanning, no
#       bypass, no write-zero, no restore loops -- space_match_take is deleted
#       with the theory it served.  The second stream (1, gfx3d_lpac) goes
#       through the same context at entry 2, as the device tree has it.
#     - Kept from R17: the 3D core's pages get UNPRIVILEGED (PTE_CORE), the
#       microcode page is READ_ONLY and skips the file's first word, the
#       context's SCTLR carries SERVE_AFTER_FAULT, the 10 s waits and the
#       non-fatal 0x402 tolerance.  Nothing of R17 is touched.
#   PACKAGING: unchanged from R17 (R13 volume bytes behind the eight content gates).
